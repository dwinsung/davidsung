 Hi! The purpose of this notebook is to, using particular given census data, determine which factors play the biggest role as to whether an individual makes over or under 50K annually and to develop a predictive classifier to determine whether a random individual would make over or under 50K annually. Our dataset comprises of both categorical and numerical data ranging from living to economic attributes.
