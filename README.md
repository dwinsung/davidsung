 Hi! The purpose of this notebook is to, using particular given census data, determine which factors play the biggest role as to whether an individual makes over or under 50K annually and to develop a predictive classifier to determine whether a random individual would make over or under 50K annually. Our dataset comprises of both categorical and numerical data ranging from living to economic attributes. 



##### Intuitvely, I initially thought that he factors most related to whether an individual would make 50K would most likely be factors having to do with age, education, and occupation information. In my experience, the older an individual is, the more money he/she makes, and today's market salaries are pretty heavily dependent on the role and industry one is currently in. I'll be keeping a close eye out to specifically the age, education, and industry of each individual.

##### Conclusively, I found that while these factors are the most correlated with whether an individual makes 50K, it is difficult to accurately determine whether an individual actually makes 50K; our model resulted in a high proportion of false positives. While feature selection did show clear correlation, without further info, it's hard to say whether these factors are the "determinant" or just correlated. With more time, I believe a more thorough data cleaning would most likely rid us of false positives  (along with some model tweaking!).
